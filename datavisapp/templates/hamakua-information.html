    <h3>Hamakua Marsh History </h3>
</div>

<!-- Paragraph about the web app -->
<div class="paragraph">
    <p1>
        The Hamakua Marsh located in Kailua HI, consists of 90 acres of which 68 acres are upland, 
        and 22 acres are wetland. The marsh was declared a wildlife sanctuary in 1997 and is divided 
        into 4 basins (A, B, C, & D) each of which contains varying sizes of wetland, water and vegetation. 
        The area had a long history of serving early Hawaiian settlers through farming and fishing.

<div class="paragraph2">
    <p1> 
        The marsh was eventually degraded due to heavy use, and after a few failed attempts from developers 
        to acquire permits to redevelop the land for retail or housing, it is now a haven for local Hawaiian
        wildlife thanks to the help of nonprofit organizations such as Ducks Unlimited who redeveloped the land 
        into a sanctuary. Notably the area is a refuge to waterbirds such as the Hawaiian coot (alae keʻo keʻo), 
        Hawaiian moorhen (alae ʻula), Hawaiian stilt (ae'o kukuluao) and the Hawaiian duck (koloa maol). However, 
        the sanctuary faces threats from invasive plants such as pickleweed that take up space in the wetland 
        covering mudflats as well as shallow water and open water areas, this poses a threat to all the local
         Hawaiian waterbirds as they depend on these habitats to breed, nest and feed themselves.
